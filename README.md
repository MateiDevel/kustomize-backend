# kustomize
- A handy tool for KDE Plasma users to switch from a rice to another 

# Notice
- When exporting the .config directory it will be hidden by default. In dolphin, press ```CTRL + h``` to show hidden files

# Current features
- Can import and export the global config
- Can export the entire config tree

# Under construction
- Bunch of features to be added (p.s. my first C project, might be crap)
- Refactor code cuz it sucks
- Will automatically install themes if not installed

# Setup

## **Install Dependencies:**
- Debian based:
``` 
sudo apt install cmake build-essential
